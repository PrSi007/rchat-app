RCHAT-APP

## Purpose

As now more than 70% of total visits on top digital news websites come from mobile devices, the need for developing chat apps has escalated. <br/>

A lot of traffic and referrals observed on news organizations belong to social platforms, which translates into a great opportunity for relationship building and audience engagement.<br/>

Chat messengers present themselves as representatives of socials on mobile and drive the size of traffic too huge to ignore.<br/>

rchat-app is a group chat application with a user friendly interface that provides instant messaging using socket.io .<br/>
